The ideology behind the CreateInstall installer is based on two main principles.
Complete control over the installation process and unlimited scalability. 
If you want to know what your installation package does step by step and want to it to perform certain operations at certain times,
CreateInstall is the perfect choice for you. 
If other installers lack features, it is highly probable that these features are already implemented 
or can be implemented in CreateInstall. 
Even if your requirements for your installation packages change, CreateInstall can handle these changes. 
When you install CreateInstall you also receive the additional application CreateInstall Assistant. 
It has a very simple interface and allows you to quickly create installations without additional study of the program.
